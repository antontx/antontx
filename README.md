> My name is anton and I am really interested in __algorithms & machine learning__ *(paper release mid 2023)*. Over the past few years I taught myself how to code in various different programming languages, the languages" I write the most fluent are Java (game development & algorithmic) and Python (scientific work, algorithmic) but I recently started getting more into C and C# aswell.
